<p><strong>Nature’s Champion</strong>. While the archdruid is conscious, wearing no armor, and in a natural environment or terrain, such as a desert, forest, or mountain, it adds its WIS modifier to its AC (included above). In addition, it is resistant to cold, fire, lightning, poison, and thunder damage.</p>
<p><strong>Nature’s Weapons</strong>. When the archdruid hits with any weapon, the weapon deals an extra 4d8 cold, fire, lightning, poison, or thunder damage (included in the attack), the archdruid’s choice.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Actions</h3>
<p><strong>Multiattack</strong>. The archdruid makes three Thorned Staff or Nature’s Wrath attacks. It can replace one attack with a use of Spellcasting.</p>
<p><strong>Thorned Staff</strong>. Melee Weapon Attack: + 7 to hit, reach 5. ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) piercing damage plus 18 (4d8) cold, fire, lightning, poison, or thunder damage (the archdruid’s choice).</p>
<p><strong>Nature’s Wrath</strong>. Ranged Spell Attack: + 9 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. Hit: 27 (5d8 + 5) cold, fire, lightning, poison, or thunder damage (the archdruid’s choice).</p>
<p><strong>Spellcasting</strong>. The archdruid casts one of the following spells, using WIS as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 17).</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Bonus Actions</h3>
<p><strong>Change Shape</strong>. The archdruid magically transforms into a Beast that has a challenge rating no higher than its own, or back into its true form, which is Humanoid. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying transforms with it. It reverts to its true form if it dies. In a new form, the archdruid retains its HP, ability to speak, proficiencies, and INT, WIS, and CHA modifiers, as well as this bonus action. Its statistics and capabilities are otherwise replaced by those of the new form, except any class features or legendary actions of that form.</p>
<p><strong>– The archdruid can choose to instead magically transform into an Elemental that has a challenge rating no higher than 6, or back into its true form</strong>. If it transforms into an Elemental, the archdruid can remain in that form for up to 6 hours then must finish a short or long rest before it can transform into an Elemental again.</p>

<p><strong>Magic Resistance</strong>. The archmage has advantage on saves against spells and other magical effects.</p>
<p><strong>Magic Ward</strong>. While the archmage is conscious, wearing no armor, and not inside of an antimagic effect, it adds its INT modifier to its AC (included above). In addition, it is resistant to force damage.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Actions</h3>
<p><strong>Multiattack</strong>. The archmage makes three Arcane Blast attacks. It can replace one attack with a use of Spellcasting.</p>
<p><strong>Arcane Blast</strong>. Melee or Ranged Spell Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 60 ft., one target. Hit: 27 (4d10 + 5) force damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 17 STR save or be pushed up to 10 feet away from the archmage and knocked prone.</p>
<p><strong>Burst of Magic (Recharge 5-6)</strong>. The archmage releases a burst of swirling, multicolored, magical energy on a point it can see within 60 feet of it. Each creature within 20 feet of that point must make a DC 17 DEX save, taking 33 (6d10) force damage and 18 (4d8) acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage (the archmage’s choice) on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
<p><strong>Spellcasting</strong>. The archmage casts one of the following spells, using INT as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 17).</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Bonus Actions</h3>
<p><strong>Shimmering Step</strong>. The archmage teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space it can see. Sparks of arcane energy appear at the origin and destination when it uses this bonus action.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Reactions</h3>
<p><strong>Counter Spell</strong>. When a creature the archmage can see within 30 feet of it casts a spell, the archmage can counter the spell, interrupting the casting. This reaction works like the counterspell spell with a +5 spellcasting ability check, except the archmage must always make the ability check, regardless of the spell’s circle. The archmage has advantage on this check if the spell is on the Arcane source spell list.</p>

<p><strong>Legendary Resistance (3/Day)</strong>. If the lich fails a save, it can choose to succeed instead.</p>
<p><strong>Rejuvenation</strong>. If it has a phylactery, a destroyed lich gains a new body in 1d10 days, regaining all its HP and becoming active again. The new body appears within 5 feet of the phylactery.</p>
<p><strong>Turn Resistance</strong>. The lich has advantage on saves against any effect that turns undead.</p>
<p><strong>Undead Nature</strong>. The lich doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</p>
<p><strong>Undead Resilience</strong>. The lich is immune to poison damage,  to exhaustion, and to the poisoned condition.</p>
<p><strong>Versatile Artist</strong>. At the end of each long rest, the lich chooses one form of artistic expression, such as song, poetry, dance, fashion, paint, or similar. Until it finishes a long rest, the lich has immunity to one type of damage, which is associated with its artistic expression. For example, a lich expressing art through song or poetry has immunity to thunder damage, a lich expressing art through fashion has immunity to slashing damage, and a lich expressing art through paint has immunity to acid damage. This trait can’t give the lich immunity to force, psychic, or radiant damage.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Actions</h3>
<p><strong>Multiattack</strong>. The virtuoso lich uses Corrupted Art. It then makes three Artistic Flourish attacks. It can replace one attack with a use of Spellcasting.</p>
<p><strong>Artistic Flourish</strong>. Melee or Ranged Spell Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 60 ft., one target. Hit: 18 (3d8 + 5) damage of the type chosen with the Versatile Artist trait plus 9 (2d8) force damage.</p>
<p><strong>Call Muse</strong>. The lich chooses one Beast or Humanoid it can  see within 30 feet of it to be its muse. The target must succeed on a DC 17 WIS save or become the lich’s muse and be charmed by the lich for 1 minute. While charmed, the muse has a speed of 0 and is incapacitated as it watches or listens to the lich’s artistic expression. The muse can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature’s save is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the lich’s Call Muse for the next 24 hours. If the muse suffers harm from the lich, it is no longer charmed.  	 The lich can have only one muse at a time. If it charms another, the effect on the previous muse ends. If the lich is within 30 feet of its muse and can see its muse, the lich has advantage on its first Artistic Flourish attack each round against a creature that isn’t its muse.</p>
<p><strong>Corrupted Art</strong>. The lich hums a discordant melody, paints a crumbling symbol of death in the air, performs a reality-bending pirouette, or emulates some other expression of corrupted or twisted art and targets one creature it can see, other than itself, within 60 feet. This action’s effects change, depending on if the target is Undead.</p>
<p><strong>–   Non-Undead</strong>. The target must make a DC 17 WIS save. On a failure, a creature is blinded, charmed, or deafened (the lich’s choice) until the end of its next turn. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t incapacitated.</p>
<p><strong>–   Undead</strong>. The target regains 18 (4d8) HP. Healing that exceeds the target’s HP maximum becomes temporary HP.</p>
<p><strong>Spellcasting</strong>. The lich casts one of the following spells, using CHA as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 17).</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Legendary Actions</h3>
<p>The virtuoso lich can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. The lich regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.</p>
<p><strong>Call Muse</strong>. The lich uses Call Muse.</p>
<p><strong>Move</strong>. The lich moves up to its speed without provoking opportunity attacks.</p>
<p><strong>Cast a Spell (Costs 2 Actions)</strong>. The lich uses Spellcasting.</p>
<p><strong>Unrestrained Art (Costs 3 Actions)</strong>. The lich unleashes the full force of its artistic talents. Each creature with 15 feet of the lich must make a DC 17 DEX save. On a failure, a creature takes 9 (2d8) damage of the type chosen with the Versatile Artist trait and is knocked prone. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t knocked prone.</p>
