    <div data-toc></div>
  </aside>
  <div class="content"><p>Here is a revised version in a D&amp;D-style rulebook voice, with headings, short paragraphs, and imperative phrasing:</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p><strong>Easy Tabletop Fantasy Overview</strong></p>
<p>Easy Tabletop Fantasy is a streamlined adaptation of the fifth edition of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons rules, designed for new players and quick-start campaigns. Easy Tabletop Fantasy teaches the core gameplay loop quickly and intuitively, without heavy arithmetic, complex corner cases, or excessive dice handling. The focus is on clear choices, consistent procedures, and a strong sense of time and consequence at the table. The standard rules of the fifth edition of Dungeons &amp; Dragons apply, except where this document explicitly replaces or overrides them.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Design Goals</h3>
<p>Easy Tabletop Fantasy favors speed of play, consistent resolution, and ease of learning. It uses a single core mechanic, a compressed numerical scale, and a limited set of meaningful decisions. The system is designed so that players always understand what their actions cost, where their capabilities come from, and what effects their choices have on the fiction at the table.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Dice and Tests</h3>
<p>Easy Tabletop Fantasy uses the d20 for nearly all resolution.</p>
<p>All actions, attacks, saving throws, and ability checks are d20 tests. Some spells apply a d4 as a bonus or penalty to a d20 roll; alternatively, you can use a fixed modifier of +4 or −4 in place of the die. Easy Tabletop Fantasy does not use separate damage rolls: damage is resolved as <strong>hits</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Ability Scores</h3>
<p>Easy Tabletop Fantasy replaces the six traditional ability scores with three core ability statistics:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fitness</strong> combines Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution.</li>
<li><strong>Insight</strong> reflects the rational aspect of Intelligence and Wisdom.</li>
<li><strong>Willpower</strong> reflects the mystical and force-of-personality aspect of Wisdom and Charisma.</li>
</ul>
<p>Easy Tabletop Fantasy uses ability modifiers only. There are no underlying scores and no derived modifiers as in the core fifth edition rules. The value recorded for each ability is the modifier applied to all related tests, attacks, and defenses.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Determining Ability Modifiers</h3>
<p>When you create a character, choose one of the following methods to determine your ability modifiers. In both methods, you work only with modifiers; you do not track ability scores.</p>
<p><strong>Fixed Array</strong></p>
<p>Assign the modifiers +2, +1, and +0 to Fitness, Insight, and Willpower in any order. No ability can start higher than +2.</p>
<p><strong>Point Allocation</strong></p>
<p>You start with 3 modifier points to distribute among Fitness, Insight, and Willpower.</p>
<ul>
<li>Starting value per ability: 0</li>
<li>Maximum per ability: +2</li>
<li>Minimum per ability: −1</li>
<li>You may “borrow” points by lowering an ability below 0, down to a minimum of −1.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>Converting Ability Scores (D&amp;D 5e to Easy Tabletop Fantasy)</h3>
<p>When you convert an existing fifth edition character, use this procedure to derive the three Easy Tabletop Fantasy abilities. This process is only used during conversion; after conversion, you record modifiers only.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Calculate composite scores.</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Fitness: Add Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution, divide the total by 3, and round down.</li>
<li>Insight: Add Intelligence and Wisdom, divide the total by 2, and round down.</li>
<li>Willpower: Add Wisdom and Charisma, divide the total by 2, and round down.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><strong>Determine modifiers.</strong></li>
<li>For each composite score, determine the modifier using the standard fifth edition formula:</li>
</ol>
<div class="formula-box">
  <span class="formula-label">Ability Modifier</span>
  <span class="formula-equation">
    <span class="variable">modifier</span>
    <span class="operator">=</span>
    <span>⌊</span>
    <span class="variable">(score</span>
    <span class="operator">−</span>
    <span>10)</span>
    <span class="operator">÷</span>
    <span>2</span>
    <span>⌋</span>
  </span>
</div>
<p>Record only the resulting three modifiers on the Easy Tabletop Fantasy character sheet. The intermediate composite scores are not used in play.</p>
<p><strong>Example: Converting Ability Scores</strong></p>
<p>Given the following fifth edition scores: Strength 14, Dexterity 10, Constitution 13, Intelligence 11, Wisdom 16, Charisma 12.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fitness = (14 + 10 + 13) / 3 = 37 / 3 = 12 (round down) → modifier +1</li>
<li>Insight = (11 + 16) / 2 = 27 / 2 = 13 (round down) → modifier +1</li>
<li>Willpower = (16 + 12) / 2 = 28 / 2 = 14 → modifier +2</li>
</ul>
<p>The Easy Tabletop Fantasy modifiers are: Fitness +1, Insight +1, Willpower +2.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Proficiency and Advantage</h3>
<p>Easy Tabletop Fantasy uses a stacking advantage system instead of proficiency bonuses. When you are proficient with something (such as a weapon, armor, skill, or saving throw), you gain advantage on related rolls. Advantage means you roll two d20s and take the higher result.</p>
<p>Advantage can stack. If you have multiple sources of advantage, you roll additional d20s and take the highest. For example, if you have proficiency (1 advantage) and another source grants advantage, you roll 3d20 and take the highest. This is called "stacking advantage."</p>
<p>Disadvantage works similarly but in reverse—you roll multiple d20s and take the lowest. Advantage and disadvantage cancel each other out on a one-to-one basis.</p>
<p>Your proficiency level determines how many advantage dice you gain:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Proficient:</strong> You have advantage (roll 2d20, take highest)</li>
<li><strong>Expertise:</strong> You have double advantage (roll 3d20, take highest)</li>
<li><strong>Mastery:</strong> You have triple advantage (roll 4d20, take highest)</li>
</ul>
<p>Proficiency is typically granted by your class, background, or feats. When converting from D&amp;D 5e or Tales of the Valiant, proficiency bonuses are replaced by advantage on the relevant rolls.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Skills and Ability Checks</h3>
<p>Easy Tabletop Fantasy does not use a fixed skill list like Athletics, Arcana, or Stealth by default. All ability checks are made directly with Fitness, Insight, or Willpower. Classes, backgrounds, and feats can grant specific skills; only those listed skills benefit from the character's proficiency advantage, granting you advantage on ability checks made with that skill.</p>
<p>The core ability always forms the basis of the roll. Skills indicate where a character has additional training or talent and make explicit why the character is good at a particular task. When converting from fifth edition, record only the skills the character actually possesses. This approach keeps character sheets compact and supports clear, consistent roleplaying.</p>
<p>Because there is no fixed global skill list, new or setting-specific skills can be attached to classes, backgrounds, or feats without friction, making Easy Tabletop Fantasy flexible and easy to expand.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Hit Points and Scale</h3>
<p>Easy Tabletop Fantasy uses a compressed hit point scale. Most creatures have roughly one-tenth of their fifth edition hit points (rounded up). Player characters track hit points using the following expression:</p>
<div class="formula-box">
  <span class="formula-label">Hit Points</span>
  <span class="formula-equation">
    <span class="variable">HP</span>
    <span class="operator">=</span>
    <span class="variable">class hit die maximum</span>
    <span class="operator">+</span>
    <span class="variable">Fitness modifier</span>
    <span class="operator">+</span>
    <span>(</span>
    <span class="variable">level</span>
    <span class="operator">−</span>
    <span>1</span>
    <span>)</span>
  </span>
</div>
<p>Damage and healing are expressed in <strong>hits</strong> (or <strong>wounds</strong>) rather than raw numbers.</p>
<div class="table-wrap"><table>
<thead><tr><th>Class</th><th>HP</th><th>Class</th><th>HP</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>Artificer</td><td>8</td><td>Paladin</td><td>10</td></tr>
<tr><td>Barbarian</td><td>12</td><td>Ranger</td><td>10</td></tr>
<tr><td>Bard</td><td>8</td><td>Rogue</td><td>8</td></tr>
<tr><td>Cleric</td><td>8</td><td>Sorcerer</td><td>6</td></tr>
<tr><td>Druid</td><td>8</td><td>Warlock</td><td>8</td></tr>
<tr><td>Fighter</td><td>10</td><td>Wizard</td><td>6</td></tr>
<tr><td>Monk</td><td>8</td><td></td><td></td></tr>
</tbody></table></div>
<hr>
<h3>Level Advancement</h3>
<p>Easy Tabletop Fantasy characters advance from level 1 to level 10. Every two fifth edition levels combine into one Easy Tabletop Fantasy level:</p>
<ul>
<li>Levels 1–2 → Easy Tabletop Fantasy level 1</li>
<li>Levels 3–4 → Easy Tabletop Fantasy level 2</li>
<li>Levels 5–6 → Easy Tabletop Fantasy level 3</li>
<li>and so on</li>
</ul>
<p>This structure ensures that each new level provides a noticeable increase in power and that class progression, including spellcasting progression, remains coherent and easy to track.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Attacks and Defense</h3>
<p>Easy Tabletop Fantasy resolves combat with a single attack roll and fixed damage in hits. On a successful attack roll with a weapon, the target takes 1 hit. A critical hit deals 2 hits. Weapons provide bonuses to hit, not to damage.</p>
<ul>
<li>On a failed attack roll: The attack deals no damage.</li>
<li>On a natural 1: The attacker suffers a critical failure, and the target immediately makes a reaction counter‑attack.</li>
<li>On a natural 20: The attack deals 2 hits and triggers exploding dice—roll again. If you roll another natural 20, you deal 2 hits again and roll again. This effect stacks, allowing multiple critical hits in a single attack.</li>
</ul>
<p>When a creature attacks a player character, the character makes a Defense roll:</p>
<div class="formula-box">
  <span class="formula-label">Defense Roll</span>
  <span class="formula-equation">
    <code class="dice">d20</code>
    <span class="operator">+</span>
    <span class="variable">Defense bonus</span>
  </span>
</div>
<p>The Defense roll is made against a target number determined by the Game Master. For a creature that would normally attack at +X to hit, the target number is 11 + X. Your Defense roll total must meet or beat the attack's target number to avoid damage.</p>
<ul>
<li>On a failed Defense roll (roll total below target number): The character takes 1 hit.</li>
<li>On a natural 1: The attack becomes a critical hit, and the character takes 2 hits.</li>
<li>On a natural 20: The character takes no damage and can immediately make a reaction counter‑attack.</li>
</ul>
<p>As an option, a group can instead retain the standard fifth edition Armor Class rules for resolving attacks against player characters.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Weapon and Bonus Conversion</h3>
<p>Weapon damage dice from fifth edition convert to fixed bonuses to hit in Easy Tabletop Fantasy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unarmed: +0</li>
<li>d4: +1</li>
<li>d6: +2</li>
<li>d8: +3</li>
<li>d10: +4</li>
<li>d12: +5</li>
<li>2d6: +6</li>
</ul>
<p>Weapon attack rolls use the following formula:</p>
<div class="formula-box">
  <span class="formula-label">Attack Roll</span>
  <span class="formula-equation">
    <code class="dice">d20</code>
    <span class="operator">+</span>
    <span class="variable">weapon bonus</span>
    <span class="operator">+</span>
    <span class="variable">ability modifier</span>
    <span class="operator">+</span>
    <span class="variable">(advantage if proficient)</span>
  </span>
</div>
<p><strong>Example: Weapon Attack Roll</strong></p>
<p>A fighter with Fitness +2 and a shortsword (attack bonus +2) who is proficient with martial weapons makes an attack roll with advantage (roll 2d20, take highest) + 2 (weapon) + 2 (Fitness) = highest of 2d20 + 4.</p>
<p>On a hit, the attack deals 1 hit of damage. Easy Tabletop Fantasy assumes that better weapons improve the chance to hit, while spells generally increase the number of hits dealt and/or apply additional effects.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Weapon Mastery</h3>
<p>Easy Tabletop Fantasy does not use weapon mastery as a core mechanic. Weapon mastery adds an extra layer of complexity that can slow down gameplay, especially for beginners who need to pause and consider mastery options during combat. This additional decision point can interrupt the flow of play and create hesitation at the table.</p>
<p>Instead, weapon mastery effects can be achieved through <strong>improvised actions</strong>. Players are encouraged to describe creative uses of their weapons, and the Game Master can adjudicate these as improvised actions. This approach puts the focus on player creativity and narrative description rather than mechanical rules, allowing for more dynamic and engaging combat encounters.</p>
<p>The following list of weapon masteries serves as inspiration and examples for what players might attempt as improvised actions. These are not automatic abilities but rather suggestions for creative weapon use that players and Game Masters can reference when describing combat maneuvers:</p>
<div class="table-wrap">
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Mastery</th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Cleave</strong></td>
        <td>When you hit a creature, you can attempt to strike another creature within reach with the same attack.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Graze</strong></td>
        <td>When you miss with an attack, you still deal a small amount of damage (typically 1 hit on a near miss).</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Nick</strong></td>
        <td>When you make an attack, you can attempt a quick, light strike that might allow for an additional action.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Push</strong></td>
        <td>When you hit, you can attempt to push the target away from you, potentially moving them or knocking them prone.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Sap</strong></td>
        <td>When you hit, you can attempt to daze or stun the target, potentially reducing their effectiveness.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Slow</strong></td>
        <td>When you hit, you can attempt to slow the target's movement or actions.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Topple</strong></td>
        <td>When you hit, you can attempt to knock the target prone or off balance.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Vex</strong></td>
        <td>When you hit, you can attempt to create an opening or advantage for your next attack.</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>
<p>Remember: these are examples for inspiration. Players should describe what they want to accomplish, and the Game Master determines the appropriate test, difficulty, and outcome based on the situation and the rules for improvised actions.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Damage Conversion (Spells and Effects)</h3>
<p>Damage and healing expressed in dice are converted into hits for Easy Tabletop Fantasy. To convert dice-based values from fifth edition:</p>
<ol>
<li>Take the maximum total of the dice expression.</li>
<li>Divide by 6.</li>
<li>Round the result to the nearest whole number.</li>
</ol>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>3d4 → maximum 12 → 12 / 6 = 2 hits</li>
<li>1d8 → maximum 8 → 8 / 6 ≈ 1 hit</li>
<li>2d8 → maximum 16 → 16 / 6 ≈ 3 hits</li>
</ul>
<p>For mixed expressions, convert dice and flat bonuses separately, then add the results.</p>
<p>Example: 2d4 + 5</p>
<ul>
<li>Dice: maximum 8 → 8 / 6 ≈ 1 hit</li>
<li>Static bonus: 5 / 6 ≈ 1 hit</li>
<li>Total: 2 hits.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>Actions and Time (Encounter Mode)</h3>
<p>Easy Tabletop Fantasy resolves turns in <strong>Moments</strong> rather than traditional action types. Each turn consists of 3 Moments. Each Moment represents a chunk of time devoted to an action or movement.</p>
<ul>
<li>Move up to your full speed: 1 Moment</li>
<li>Cast a cantrip or take a bonus action: 1 Moment</li>
<li>Take an action (attack, interact, etc.): 1 Moment</li>
<li>Cast a leveled spell: usually 2 Moments unless otherwise noted</li>
</ul>
<p>This structure ensures that every choice has a clear time cost and that different actions are easy to compare at the table.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Magic and Spell Resources</h3>
<p>Easy Tabletop Fantasy measures a caster's capacity with <strong>Spell Power</strong>:</p>
<div class="formula-box">
  <span class="formula-label">Spell Power</span>
  <span class="formula-equation">
    <span class="variable">Spell Power</span>
    <span class="operator">=</span>
    <span>3</span>
    <span class="operator">×</span>
    <span class="variable">spellcasting ability modifier</span>
  </span>
</div>
<p>The Spell Power cost of a spell equals its spell level. A spellcaster spends Spell Power to cast spells and regains it through rest and Recovery Points.</p>
<p><strong>Example: Magic Missile</strong></p>
<p>Magic Missile costs 1 Spell Power to cast and creates three missiles. Each missile deals 1 hit of damage, automatically hits, and ignores defenses. Each additional Spell Power spent when casting Magic Missile creates one extra missile.</p>
<p>Spells can also apply additional effects, such as fire, frost, control, or movement, as described in their individual entries.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Resolve</h3>
<p>Resolve represents a character’s growing determination and focus after setbacks. Each time a character fails a d20 test—no matter the type of roll—the character gains 1 Resolve. Resolve can accumulate, up to a maximum of 4.</p>
<p>When a character with 4 Resolve fails a d20 test, roll a d4. The result becomes the character’s new Resolve value, replacing the previous total. Resolve is then available as a resource to interact with advanced rules, features, or optional systems defined elsewhere in Easy Tabletop Fantasy (for example, to boost rolls or activate special abilities).</p>
<hr>
<h3>Recovery Points and Rest</h3>
<p>During a short rest, a character gains a pool of <strong>Recovery Points</strong> equal to the character’s level. The player can spend Recovery Points to restore hit points and/or Spell Power in any combination. Unspent Recovery Points remain available for later short rests until they are used.</p>
<p>A character’s maximum Recovery Points equal the character’s level. During a long rest, a character regains half of their total Recovery Points (rounded up), similar to the way hit dice are recovered in the core fifth edition rules.</p>
<p><strong>Restoring Hearts:</strong> Restoring a lost heart requires one long rest. During this rest, however, no HP is restored; HP must be regained separately through spells, healing, or other effects. Only when the number of hearts is back to 3 does a long rest also restore HP again. The order of recovery during a long rest is always: first hearts, then HP. See the <a href="combat.html#life-and-death-saves">Life and Death Saves</a> section for more details on hearts and death saves.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Spell School Expertise</h3>
<p>Some spellcasters specialize in particular schools of magic. A character with expertise in a spell school gains double advantage (roll 3d20, take highest) on spell attack rolls for spells of that school, and targets of those spells have disadvantage (roll 2d20, take lowest) on saving throws against them.</p>
<p>The number of spell schools in which a caster is proficient is equal to their spellcasting ability modifier divided by 2, rounded up.</p></div>
