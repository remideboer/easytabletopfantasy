  <h1>Lineages</h1>
  <div class="content">
    <p class="lede">Lineage represents the blood ties and hereditary traits of a creature. It's what you're born to, no matter where you were born.</p>
    
    <p>In Easy Tabletop Fantasy, <strong>lineage</strong> is the concept that replaces the traditional "species" or "race" system from D&amp;D. Lineages provide fundamental traits that shape who your character is, representing their ancestry and hereditary characteristics.</p>
    
    <p>Each lineage provides specific traits, ability score increases (which you'll adapt to the Easy Tabletop Fantasy three-ability system), and other features. When applying lineage ability score increases to Easy Tabletop Fantasy, work with your Game Master to determine how traditional ability score bonuses translate to Fitness, Insight, or Willpower modifiers.</p>

        <div class="lineage-content">
          <p><strong>Your elf character has the following hereditary traits.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Age.</strong> Although elves reach physical maturity around age 18, the elven understanding of adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encompass worldly experience. An elf typically claims adulthood and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live to be 750 years old.</p>
          <p><strong>Size.</strong> Elves range from under 5 to over 6 feet tall and have slender builds. Your size is Medium.</p>
          <p><strong>Speed.</strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
          <p><strong>Darkvision.</strong> You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p>
          <p><strong>Keen Senses.</strong> You have proficiency in the Perception skill.</p>
          <p><strong>Fey Ancestry.</strong> You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put you to sleep.</p>
          <p><strong>Trance.</strong> Elves don't need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is "trance.") While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.</p>
          <p><strong>Languages.</strong> You can speak, read, and write Common and Elvish.</p>
