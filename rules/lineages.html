  <h1>Lineages</h1>
  <div class="content">
    <p class="lede">Lineage represents the blood ties and hereditary traits of a creature. It's what you're born to, no matter where you were born.</p>
    
    <p>In Easy Tabletop Fantasy, <strong>lineage</strong> is the concept that replaces the traditional "species" or "race" system from D&amp;D. Lineages provide fundamental traits that shape who your character is, representing their ancestry and hereditary characteristics.</p>
    
    <p>Each lineage provides specific traits, ability score increases (which you'll adapt to the Easy Tabletop Fantasy three-ability system), and other features. When applying lineage ability score increases to Easy Tabletop Fantasy, work with your Game Master to determine how traditional ability score bonuses translate to Fitness, Insight, or Willpower modifiers.</p>

          <span class="lineage-toggle-icon">▼</span>
        </button>
        <div class="lineage-content">
          <p><strong>Your beastkin character has the following hereditary traits.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Age.</strong> Beastkin mature far more quickly than most Humanoids, reaching adulthood within 5 years. Though they may live nearly a century, some beastkin live only 20 or 30 years.</p>
          <p><strong>Size.</strong> Your size is Medium or Small. Beastkin vary in weight and height, depending on their Beast characteristics. Most are between 4 and 8 feet tall, but if you choose to play a beastkin shorter than 4 feet, you can choose your size to be Small. Your weight varies depending on your Beast characteristics. For example, a Medium beastkin descended from bears likely weighs upward of 350 pounds, while an avian beastkin of the same size is likely to weigh around 100 pounds.</p>
          <p><strong>Speed.</strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
          <p><strong>Animal Instinct.</strong> You have proficiency in either the Perception or Survival skill (your choice).</p>
          <p><strong>Natural Weapons.</strong> You have claws, horns, hooves, fangs, spines, or a similar adaptation that serves as a natural weapon. Work with your GM to determine what type of natural weapon you possess and decide whether it does bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage. You can use your natural weapon to make unarmed strikes. When you hit with it, the strike deals 1 Hit + your Fitness modifier, instead of the 1 Hit damage normal for an unarmed strike.</p>
          <p><strong>Natural Adaptation.</strong> You inherit one of the following traits determined by what kind of animal characteristics you want your character to have:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Avian.</strong> Leathery, feathery, or gossamer wings sprout from your back or connect to your outstretched arms. You have a flying speed equal to your walking speed. You can't fly while wearing medium or heavy armor. Carrying a heavy load or a creature of your size or larger while flying reduces your speed by half.</li>
            <li><strong>Agile.</strong> Sharp claws, cloven hooves, robust limbs, reversed joints, or suction pads on your hands and feet allow you to scrabble up trees, rock faces, and uneven surfaces with ease. You have a climbing speed equal to your walking speed. In addition, you have advantage on saves made to avoid being knocked prone.</li>
            <li><strong>Aquatic.</strong> Oily fur, scales, fins, webbed hands and feet, or long, gangly limbs are common for your people. You have a swimming speed equal to your walking speed. You can hold your breath for up to 20 minutes.</li>
            <li><strong>Sturdy.</strong> Powerful limbs, fat reserves, or a thick hide allow you to endure harm and accomplish feats of remarkable athleticism. When you aren't wearing armor, you have a natural AC of 13 + your Fitness modifier. In addition, you count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push or drag.</li>

          <p><strong>Your dwarf character has the following hereditary traits.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Age.</strong> Dwarves are physically mature around age 20, but most consider themselves young until they reach age 50. On average, they live about 350 years.</p>
          <p><strong>Size.</strong> Your size is Medium. Dwarves vary little in height or size, with most standing between 4 and 5 feet tall. Even the smallest dwarves possess broad frames and rarely weigh less than 150 pounds.</p>
          <p><strong>Speed.</strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
          <p><strong>Darkvision.</strong> You have darkvision to a range of 60 feet.</p>
          <p><strong>Dwarven Resilience.</strong> You have advantage on saves against becoming poisoned, and you are resistant to poison damage.</p>
          <p><strong>Dwarven Toughness.</strong> Your hit point maximum increases by 1, and it increases by 1 every time you gain a level.</p>

          <p><strong>Your elf character has the following hereditary traits.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Age.</strong> Although elves reach physical maturity around age 20, mental and emotional faculties reach full maturity around the age of 100. Elves can live to be 750 years old.</p>
          <p><strong>Size.</strong> Your size is Medium. Elves range from under 5 feet to over 6 feet tall and tend toward slender builds, averaging around 110 pounds.</p>
          <p><strong>Speed.</strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
          <p><strong>Heightened Senses.</strong> You have advantage on Perception checks that rely on sight or hearing. You can see through lightly obscured areas normally and areas of dim light as if it were bright light.</p>
          <p><strong>Magic Ancestry.</strong> You have advantage on saves against being charmed, and magic can't put you to sleep.</p>
          <p><strong>Trance.</strong> Elves don't need to sleep. Instead, they enter a meditative trance state, remaining semiconscious for 4 hours a day. You choose whether or not you can dream while meditating. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that other creatures do from 8 hours of sleep.</p>

          <span class="lineage-title">Gnoll</span>
          <span class="lineage-toggle-icon">▼</span>
        </button>
        <div class="lineage-content">
          <p>Gnolls look like hyenas given humanoid bearing. Their powerfully built bodies are covered with short brown or dull yellow fur spotted in darker brown. The claws on their hands and feet, while often painted or decorated with whorls, are brittle and ill-suited as weapons. Gnolls find most clothing restrictive and uncomfortable and favor short kilts or skirts with hardened leather mail or a leather apron to protect the torso. They like to adorn their leather with metal links and spikes.</p>
          <p>Though they are viewed as lazy and vicious by their detractors, gnolls are no more likely to be indolent or violent than the members of any other lineage. They once lived in familial packs like the hyenas they resemble but are increasingly becoming citizens of the world and can be found in most desert and port cities. Non-adventurous gnolls gravitate toward physical occupations, such as tanning and trapping. Gnolls evidence some amount of wanderlust, and they are often found among traveling caravans or as the crew of merchant vessels.</p>
          <p>Gnolls once favored the worship of archfiends, and while some pay reverence to one demon lord or another, they are more likely to adhere to the religious mores of their chosen community, though many gnolls eschew religion entirely.</p>
          <p><strong>Gnoll Lineage Traits</strong></p>
          <p>Your gnoll character has certain hereditary traits dictated by their lineage.</p>
          <p><strong>Age.</strong> Gnolls tend to live hard lives. They reach adulthood around 12 and few see more than 70 summers.</p>
          <p><strong>Size.</strong> Gnolls are Medium size, and they range from 7 to 8 feet tall and average around 250 pounds. Females tend to be taller and more powerfully built than males.</p>
          <p><strong>Speed.</strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
          <p><strong>Darkvision.</strong> You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p>
          <p><strong>Scent Prey.</strong> You have advantage on INS (Survival) checks that rely on smell.</p>
          <p><strong>Sprinter.</strong> Your powerful legs allow you to overrun your prey. When you use your action to Dash, you move triple your speed. You can use this feature a number of times per day equal to your proficiency level (1 at level 1-2, 2 at level 3-4, 3 at level 5-6, etc.). You regain all uses when you finish a long rest.</p>

          <p><strong>Size.</strong> Your size is Medium or Small. Humans vary in height and weight, but most adults range between 5 feet and 6 feet tall and average around 150 pounds. If you choose to play a human shorter than 4 feet however, you can choose your size to be Small.</p>

          <p><strong>Ambitious.</strong> You gain proficiency in one skill of your choice, and you gain one talent of your choice. This talent can be from any of the talent lists, but you must meet the talent's prerequisites if any are required.</p>

          <p><strong>Small Stature.</strong> You can move through the space of any creature that is Medium or larger size. You can also attempt to hide when you are obscured by a creature of Medium or larger size.</p>
          <p><strong>Natural Adaptation.</strong> You inherited one of the following unique traits, determined by whether your characteristics are gnomish or halfling:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Gnomish.</strong> Your ancestors made their homes underground or in dark woodlands, providing you with darkvision to a range of 60 feet.

            <li><strong>Halfling.</strong> Your ancestors made their homes on the surface, displaying outsized pluck to drive back hostile wildlife and monsters. You have advantage on saves against being charmed or frightened.</li>

          <p><strong>Breath Weapon.</strong> You can use your action to exhale destructive energy. Your draconic ancestry determines the size, shape, and damage type of the exhalation. When you use your breath weapon, each creature in the area of the exhalation must make a Fitness saving throw. The target number for this saving throw equals 8 + your Fitness modifier + your proficiency level. Creatures have disadvantage on this save (roll 2d20, take lowest). A creature takes 1 hit on a failed save, and no damage on a successful one. The damage increases by 1 hit when you reach 6th level (2 hits), 11th level (3 hits), and 16th level (4 hits). You can't use your breath weapon again until you complete a short or long rest.</p>
          <p><strong>Damage Resistance.</strong> You have resistance to the damage type associated with your draconic ancestry.</p>
          <p><strong>Languages.</strong> You can speak, read, and write Common and Draconic.</p>

        <div class="lineage-content">
          <p>Eonics hail from a dying civilization in the far future. To save their people, a small number took to the timestream to get help from ages before and after their own. Their crystal belts allow them to travel through time, but a flaw in the belts' construction prevents them from returning to their own time and place. They have become a displaced, desperate people.</p>
          <p>Little is known for certain about the eonic civilization. Their people had apparently eradicated disease, overcome the limits of mortality, and conquered socio-economic-political ills such as war and oppression.</p>
          <p>The nature of the disaster that befell their civilization is likewise unknown, though some speak of nova-portal reality destabilization, post-harmonic gravitic collapse, sunward drift, and other ominous sounding but inscrutable things.</p>
          <p>Relatively few eonics left their civilization during the first search for assistance. However, increasing numbers of them appear outside of their own time, suggesting that their civilization experienced further collapse.</p>
          <p>Eonics look like mummified humans. Although sometimes referred to as "eonic humans," the rigors of their travel has made them a different kind of creature. They speak in a stilted, formal-sounding fashion, and many of them punctuate conversations with long pauses, as though deeply considering what to say next.</p>
          <p><strong>Eonic Lineage Traits</strong></p>
          <p>Your eonic character has certain hereditary traits dictated by their lineage.</p>
          <p><strong>Age.</strong> Eonics have endured time dilation of varying degrees. The effect this has on their lifespans is unknown, but it is assumed eonics are effectively immortal and cannot die of old age.</p>
          <p><strong>Size.</strong> Your size is Medium. On average, eonics stand between 5 and 6 feet tall.</p>
          <p><strong>Speed.</strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
          <p><strong>Jittery.</strong> You are always on edge and prepared for the worst. You have advantage on initiative rolls (roll 2d20, take highest).</p>
          <p><strong>Practiced and Prepared.</strong> Before you set off through time, you learned as much as you could about the past. When you take part in events the GM determines will become part of the historical record, such as overthrowing a tyrannical ruler, you can leverage your knowledge of the past. Roll a d6 and add the result of the roll to one of your ability checks. Once you've leveraged your knowledge, you cannot do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
          <p><strong>Wizened Flesh.</strong> Time dilation has caused your skin and tissue to age at different rates. Your skin appears mummified. You have disadvantage on Willpower (Persuasion) checks, but you add your proficiency level to your Defense bonus.</p>
          <p>In addition, wearing armor burdens you. While you wear armor, you gain a number of levels of exhaustion based on the weight of armor worn:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Light armor (one level of exhaustion)</li>
            <li>Medium armor (two levels of exhaustion)</li>
            <li>Heavy armor (three levels of exhaustion)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>You recover these levels of exhaustion immediately after doffing your armor.</p>
