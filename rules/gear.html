  <p class="lede">Equipment and weapons for Easy Tabletop Fantasy characters.</p>
  
  <h2 id="armor">Armor</h2>
  <p>Wearing armor increases your Defense bonus, which improves your Defense roll when you are attacked. When you are attacked, you make a Defense roll (d20 + Defense bonus). Your Defense roll total must meet or beat the attack's target number to avoid damage. So, the higher your Defense bonus, the greater your chance of avoiding damage!</p>
  
  <h3 id="calculating-defense">Calculating Defense</h3>
  <p>A typical PC who isn't wearing armor has a Defense of their Fitness modifier.</p>
  <p>When you wear armor, use the Defense equation listed with the type of armor you are wearing instead of the typical Fitness modifier equation. See the Armor table for an armor type's Defense equation as well as specific bonuses or limitations it imposes when calculating Defense.</p>
  
  <h3 id="armor-types-proficiencies">Armor Types & Proficiencies</h3>
  <p>Armor types are categorized into three weights: light, medium, or heavy. You need proficiency in a weight of armor to use it well. For instance, a character with proficiency in light armor can wear any type of armor listed as light armor without penalty.</p>
  <p>Your character can wear any kind of armor, regardless of proficiency. However, if you don't have proficiency, you have disadvantage on all Fitness ability checks made while wearing it. You also can't cast spells while wearing armor you aren't proficient with.</p>
  
  <h4 id="light-armor">Light Armor</h4>
  <p>Light armor provides minimal protection while still allowing its wearer to move with relative ease.</p>
  <p><strong>Padded.</strong> This full-body outfit consists of quilted layers of cloth and batting.</p>
  <p><strong>Leather.</strong> The breastplate and shoulder protectors of this armor are made of leather that has been stiffened by being boiled in oil. The rest of the armor is made of softer and more flexible materials.</p>
  <p><strong>Studded Leather.</strong> Made from tough but flexible leather, studded leather is reinforced with close-set rivets or spikes.</p>
  <p><strong>Brigandine.</strong> This knee-length coat is made of heavy cloth or canvas lined with small metal plates.</p>
  
  <h4 id="medium-armor">Medium Armor</h4>
  <p>Medium armor provides more protection than light armor, but it uses bulkier materials that interfere with range of motion.</p>
  <p><strong>Hide.</strong> This full-body suit of armor consists of thick furs and pelts.</p>
  <p><strong>Chain Shirt.</strong> A chain shirt is made of interlocking metal rings that are worn between layers of clothing or leather. This armor protects the wearer's upper body and the outer layers muffle the sound of the rings rubbing against one another.</p>
  <p><strong>Scale Mail.</strong> This armor consists of a coat and leggings (and perhaps a separate skirt) of leather covered with overlapping pieces of metal, much like the scales of a fish.</p>
  <p><strong>Breastplate.</strong> This armor consists of a fitted metal chest lined with supple leather. This armor leaves limbs unprotected but provides good protection for vital organs and allows for easier movement than most medium armor.</p>
  <p><strong>Half Plate.</strong> Half plate consists of shaped metal plates that cover most of the wearer's body. It doesn't include leg protection beyond greaves attached with leather straps.</p>
  
  <h4 id="heavy-armor">Heavy Armor</h4>
  <p>Heavy armor provides the most protection of any armor type, but wearing it demands great physical prowess.</p>
  <p><strong>Ring Mail.</strong> This leather armor has heavy rings sewn into it. The rings help reinforce the armor against attacks.</p>
  <p><strong>Chain Mail.</strong> This is a head-to-toe suit of armor made of interlocking metal rings. Chain mail includes a layer of quilted fabric worn underneath the mail to prevent chafing and to cushion the impact of blows.</p>
  <p><strong>Splint.</strong> This armor is made of narrow vertical strips of metal riveted to a backing of leather that is worn over cloth padding. Flexible chain mail protects the joints.</p>
  <p><strong>Plate.</strong> Plate consists of shaped, interlocking metal plates to cover the entire body. A suit of plate includes gauntlets, heavy leather boots, a visored helmet, and thick layers of padding underneath the armor. Buckles and straps distribute the weight over the body.</p>
  
  <h4 id="shields">Shields</h4>
  <p>A shield is handheld armor that is wielded instead of worn. This means their Defense bonus can be lost if the shield is destroyed or becomes disarmed. Wielding a shield requires the use of one hand, which means a PC can't use two-handed weapons while holding a shield. You can only benefit from one shield Defense bonus at a time, even if you wield multiple shields.</p>
  <p><strong>Shield.</strong> This broad piece of wood and metal is held by a handle attached to one side.</p>

  <h3 id="getting-into-and-out-of-armor">Getting Into and Out of Armor</h3>
  <p>The time it takes to don (put on) or doff (take off) armor depends on the armor's weight.</p>
  <p><strong>Don.</strong> This is the time it takes to put on armor. You benefit from the armor's Defense only if you take the full time to don the suit of armor.</p>
  <p><strong>Doff.</strong> This is the time it takes to remove armor. If you have help, halve this time, except for shields, which take 1 action regardless of help.</p>

  <h3 id="armor-properties">Armor Properties</h3>
  <p>Many sets of armor have properties that affect their use, as shown in the Properties column of the Armor table.</p>
  <p><strong>Cumbersome.</strong> This armor is heavy and difficult to move in unless you have the required Fitness modifier. If your Fitness modifier doesn't equal or exceed the Fitness modifier listed in parentheses, your movement speed is reduced by 10 feet while you wear the armor, even if you're proficient with it.</p>
  <p><strong>Natural Materials.</strong> This armor is made from materials like wood, leather, or other organic materials. This renders the item immune to the effects of spells like <em>heat metal</em> or features like the rust monster's Antenna action.</p>
  <p><strong>Noisy.</strong> This armor imposes disadvantage on any ability checks made to avoid notice, like sneaking, hiding, or otherwise attempting to move silently.</p>

  <h2 id="weapons">Weapons</h2>
  <p>In Easy Tabletop Fantasy, weapons provide bonuses to attack rolls rather than damage dice. All successful weapon attacks deal 1 hit of damage. On a natural 20 (critical hit), the attack deals 2 hits and triggers exploding dice—roll again. If you roll another natural 20, you deal 2 hits again and roll again. This effect stacks, allowing multiple critical hits in a single attack. The weapon's attack bonus is added to your d20 roll along with your Fitness modifier. If you are proficient with the weapon, you also gain advantage on the attack roll (roll 2d20, take highest).</p>

  <h3 id="weapon-attack-bonus">Weapon Attack Bonus</h3>
  <p>Your total attack bonus with a weapon is calculated as:</p>
  <div class="formula-box">
    <span class="formula-label">Weapon Attack Bonus</span>
    <span class="formula-content">
      <span class="formula-var">d20</span>
      <span class="formula-op">+</span>
      <span class="formula-var">weapon bonus</span>
      <span class="formula-op">+</span>

      <span class="formula-op">+</span>
      <span class="formula-var">(advantage if proficient)</span>
    </span>
  </div>
  <p>For example, a fighter with Fitness +2 and a shortsword (attack bonus +2) who is proficient with martial weapons makes an attack roll with advantage (roll 2d20, take highest) + 2 (weapon) + 2 (Fitness) = highest of 2d20 + 4. On a successful hit, the attack deals 1 hit of damage.</p>
