  <h1>Talents</h1>
  <div class="content">
    <p class="lede">Talents represent the specific ways an adventurer has improved over the course of their adventures. Talents are divided into three categories: magic talents, martial talents, and technical talents. Your class typically determines which talent lists you have access to.</p>
    
    <p>Talents are gained in two main ways:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>When a character chooses their background during character creation, they select one talent from a list of options provided in the background.</li>
      <li>When a character class grants an Improvement, they choose a talent from the list specified by their class features—assuming the character meets any necessary prerequisites.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <div class="lineages-controls">
      <button id="expand-all-talents" class="lineage-control-btn" onclick="expandAllTalents()">Expand All</button>

    <h2>Magic Talents</h2>
    <p>Most magic talents affect a character's spellcasting abilities, but they also include features that strengthen the mind and defend against harmful magic effects.</p>

          <span class="lineage-toggle-icon">▼</span>
        </button>
        <div class="lineage-content">
          <p>Experience on the battlefield has given you superior focus to cast your spells. You gain these benefits:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>When you make a Fitness save to maintain concentration on a spell, treat any d20 roll of 7 or less as though you rolled an 8.</li>
            <li>When a creature provokes an opportunity attack from you, you can use your reaction to cast a cantrip instead of making a melee attack.</li>
            <li>You can use a shield or weapon you wield as a spellcasting focus. As normal, you can use the same hand or hands holding this focus to perform somatic spell components.</li>
          </ul>

        </button>
        <div class="lineage-content">
          <p>Through rigid mental exercise, you have fortified yourself against mind-altering effects. You gain these benefits:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Once per short rest, when you fail an Insight or Willpower save, you can choose to reroll the save and take the new result.</li>
            <li>When you start your turn charmed, frightened, paralyzed, or stunned, you gain 1 Resolve.</li>

        <div class="lineage-content">
          <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Spellcasting Class Feature</p>
          <p>Your study of magic has unlocked the mysteries of ritual spells. When you gain this talent, you also gain a ritual book, which contains the rituals you know. To cast a ritual spell, you must have your ritual book in hand.</p>
          <p>Choose a spell source: Arcane, Divine, Primordial, or Wyrd. You must choose your rituals from that source's spell list. Regardless of which source you choose, you use your normal spellcasting ability for these spells.</p>
          <p>When you gain your ritual book, add one ritual of each spell circle you have already unlocked via your spellcasting class. For example, a cleric who selects this talent at 4th level has spell slots for 1st and 2nd circles, so they would add one 1st-circle ritual and one 2nd-circle ritual to their book.</p>
          <p>Each time you gain access to a new circle of spell slots by gaining a level in your spellcasting class, add one new ritual spell to your book. This new ritual must be from the same circle of magic you originally chose, and it must be of a circle for which you have spell slots.</p>

        <div class="lineage-content">
          <p>Choose one of the eight schools of magic: abjuration, conjuration, divination, enchantment, evocation, illusion, necromancy, or transmutation. You gain these benefits:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>When you cast spells of your chosen school, your spell attack bonus and spell save DC are both increased by 1.</li>
            <li>If you use a spellbook to cast your spells, the gold and time you must spend copying a spell of that school into your spellbook is halved.</li>
            <li>When you spend two or more sorcery points while casting a spell of that school, you regain 1 sorcery point at the end of your turn.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>You can select this talent multiple times, selecting a different school of magic each time.</p>
