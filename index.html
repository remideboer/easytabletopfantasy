    <p class="lede"><strong>You-Meet-In-A-Tavern</strong> (YMIAT) is a beginner-friendly D&D 5e homebrew ruleset. It teaches the core of playing D&D 5e and other tabletop RPGs quickly and intuitively without the dice confussion. More looking at the table, less looking at the character sheet.</p>
    
    <h2>Design Goals</h2>
    <p><strong>You-Meet-In-A-Tavern</strong> (YMIAT) favors speed of play, consistent resolution, and ease of learning. It uses a single core mechanic, a compressed numerical scale, and a limited set of meaningful decisions. The system is designed so that players always understand what their actions cost, where their capabilities come from, and what effects their choices have on the fiction at the table.</p>
    
    <p>The ruleset is based on the <em>5.1 System Reference Document (SRD 5.1)</em> and draws on ideas from <em>Tales of the Valiant</em>, <em>Nimble</em>, and <em>Pathfinder Second Edition</em>. The rules are rewritten into a simplified, consistent homebrew for D&D 5e.</p>
    
    <div class="callout feature">
      <h2 class="callout-title">Modern foundations (what it uses)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Only uses d20's for resolution</li>
        <li>Ability modifiers only</li>
        <li>Familiar class progression, proficiency, and spellcasting structure</li>
        <li>Spell Points/Mana instead of Spell Slots/'Vancian Magic'</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Classic play values (how it feels)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Compressed hit points using hits and wounds instead of damage dice</li>
        <li>No default global skill list; only explicitly granted skills matter</li>
        <li>Time treated as a concrete resource through Moments</li>
        <li>Optional player-side defense saves, echoing early D&amp;D play</li>
        <li>Resolve emerging from failure, reinforcing risk and consequence</li>
        <li>Less optimization, more focus on cost, timing, and risk</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p class="summary">Modern mechanics, classic priorities: fast play, clear consequences, and meaningful choices.</p>
