    <p class="lede">Easy Tabletop Fantasy is a beginner-friendly fantasy roleplaying game. It teaches the core of tabletop RPGs quickly and intuitively, without heavy calculations, complex exceptions, or unnecessary dice. Clear choices, consistent rules, and an understanding of time, risk, and effect are central.</p>
    
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Easy Tabletop Fantasy is a streamlined fantasy roleplaying game designed for new players and quick-start campaigns. Easy Tabletop Fantasy teaches the core gameplay loop quickly and intuitively, without heavy arithmetic, complex corner cases, or excessive dice handling. The focus is on clear choices, consistent procedures, and a strong sense of time and consequence at the table.</p>
    
    <h2>Design Goals</h2>
    <p>Easy Tabletop Fantasy favors speed of play, consistent resolution, and ease of learning. It uses a single core mechanic, a compressed numerical scale, and a limited set of meaningful decisions. The system is designed so that players always understand what their actions cost, where their capabilities come from, and what effects their choices have on the fiction at the table.</p>
    
    <p>The system draws inspiration from modern fantasy roleplaying games and design approaches, including open rules from the <em>5.1 System Reference Document (SRD 5.1)</em>, as well as ideas and principles found in <em>Tales of the Valiant</em>, <em>Nimble</em>, and <em>Pathfinder Second Edition</em>. All rules and text are fully rewritten and form a standalone system.</p>
    
    <div class="callout feature">
      <h2 class="callout-title">Modern foundations (what it uses)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Unified d20 core mechanic for nearly all resolution</li>
        <li>Ability modifiers only; no roll-under systems or lookup tables</li>
        <li>Familiar class progression, proficiency, and spellcasting structure</li>
        <li>Clear, procedural rules language with explicit resolution steps</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Classic play values (how it feels)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Compressed hit points using hits and wounds instead of damage dice</li>
        <li>No default global skill list; only explicitly granted skills matter</li>
        <li>Time treated as a concrete resource through Moments</li>
        <li>Optional player-side defense saves, echoing early D&amp;D play</li>
        <li>Resolve emerging from failure, reinforcing risk and consequence</li>
        <li>Less optimization, more focus on cost, timing, and risk</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p class="summary">Modern mechanics, classic priorities: fast play, clear consequences, and meaningful choices.</p>
